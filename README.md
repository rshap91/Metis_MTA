# Metis_MTA
Metis First Project - Analyzing MTA Data

In this project, our goal was to provide advice to a hypothetical company looking to bring in potential clients/donors to one of their upcoming events. 

Using MTA turnstile Turnstile Data from http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html, we analyzed subway traffic patterns over the summer to determine the best locations and times for our company to deploy street teams to recruit.

The process was overall rudimentry and involved scraping the data, cleaning it, and looking for temporal and geospatial patterns. Further analysis would require pulling in more demographic data for areas surrounding subway stops as well as pulling in conversion rates from our theoretical street team expeditions.

The [.ipynp file](WTWY_Deployment.ipynb) contains the full data processing, while the [BensonProjectSlides.pdf](BensonProjectSlides.pdf) contains our summary slides for our presentation.
